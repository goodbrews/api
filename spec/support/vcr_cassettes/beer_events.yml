        loves a good ninja, and we''re no exception.  This beer has chopped, flipped
        and posed its way to its pedestal as one of our most popular and asked-about
        offerings.  \"How?\" you may ask.  Part of it is pure stealth power and part
        of it is pure secret, and we''d hve to kill you.  But the other part is the
        rich, satisfying body and hard-hitting chocolate finish with notes of coffee
        and caramel.  Carefully measured quantities of Mt. Hood, Northern Brewer,
        and Cascade hops added with masterful precision balance it all out.  Of course,
        winning a gold medal in the porter category at the 2008 Carolina Championship
        of Beer festival doesn''t hurt one''s killer reputation either.","abv":"5.3","ibu":"26.2","glasswareId":5,"srmId":26,"availableId":1,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/TACnR2\/upload_Lw45E0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/TACnR2\/upload_Lw45E0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/TACnR2\/upload_Lw45E0-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Hops \/ Carolina Championship of ","description":"This year''s Hickory Hops,
        Hickory''s 6th annual outdoor beer festival, offers plenty for everyone, from
        inexperienced beer novices to hardened beer fest veterans anxious for some
        unusual. Mark your calendar, April 12 is the date. Rain or shine, under then
        tents, from 1:00 until 7:00. No one under 21 will be allowed to enter including
        non-drinkers\/designated drivers and no pets please.\r\n\r\nThe Cask-Conditioned
        Ale Tent is a special booth set aside for beer made in a centuries old style.
        Back before the days of pressurized carbon dioxide containers and refrigeration,
        all beer was cask-conditioned. That means that the yeast is still present
        in the stainless steel or wooden cask from which it is served, although it
        has settled to the bottom and is not poured into the glass.\r\n\r\nPracticed
        today mostly by small English breweries and creative American craft brewers,
        this traditional style - in which the beer is fermented, conditioned and served
        from the same vessel - results in a remarkable different mouthfeel and flavor
        profile for most beer. Served warmer, usually at cellar temperatures of about
        55\u00b0F, and possessing noticeably less carbonation, cask-conditioned ales
        typically are smoother in texture and more prominent in flavor than their
        force-carbonated counterparts. Proper care is essential to ensure cask-conditioned
        ale''s drinkability. The effort provides a fresh and natural taste that is
        unforgettable. OHB brewer Steven Lyerly organized the Cask-Conditional Ale
        Tent.\r\n\r\nThe Carolinas Championship of Beer introduces its third rendition
        this year. Several weeks before the fest, most of the festival breweries were
        submitted beer for a blind-judged competition. In mid-April, over 120 beers
        spanning 85 different beer styles will be analyzed by a panel of certified
        judges, brewers and experienced judges. Gold, silver and bronze medals will
        be presented to winning brewers at a private brewers'' dinner prior to the
        fest. During Hickory Hops, following the first band, plaques will be awarded
        to three Best of Show winners. \r\n\r\nEnjoy the music. Be responsible. Enjoy
        the beer.","type":"festival_competition","typeDisplay":"Combo Festival\/Competition","startDate":"2008-04-12","endDate":"2008-04-12","time":"1pm
