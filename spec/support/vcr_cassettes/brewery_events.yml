        is a three-day annual event hosted by the Brewers Association, held in Denver,
        Colorado.  The festival runs from 29 September through 1 October. The GABF
        brings visitors from around the world to sample more than 2,000 different
        American beers. Over 100 beer judges from the United States and abroad evaluate
        beer in the associated competition, ultimately judging 3,300 beers entered
        by almost 500 domestic breweries. Gold, silver and bronze medals in 83 beer-style
