        45-degree plato, boiled for a full 2 hours while being continuously hopped
        with high-alpha American hops, then dry-hopped daily in the fermenter for
        a month & aged for another month on whole-leaf hops!!!\r\n\r\nOur 120 Minute
        I.P.A. is by far the biggest I.P.A. ever brewed! At about 18% abv and 120
        ibus you can see why we call this beer THE HOLY GRAIL for hopheads!\r\n\r\nWe
        brew 120 Minute IPA three times a year, but it goes fast. If you find some
        grab a few bottles, some to enjoy and some to age.","abv":"18","ibu":"120","glasswareId":5,"availableId":2,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EWlB8A\/upload_uCW7Rt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EWlB8A\/upload_uCW7Rt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EWlB8A\/upload_uCW7Rt-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma. Alcohol content is medium-high
        to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper
        in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character
        is intense it''s balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity
        esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and
        lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops
        may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale
        Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The
        intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character
        of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21
