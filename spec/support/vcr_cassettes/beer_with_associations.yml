        of great NorthWest hops. A powerful, but balanced East Coast I.P.A. with a

        India Pale Ale","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived
        to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high
        alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like,
        piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that
        one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end,
        but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other
        national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a
        crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery
        hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception
        of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes
        to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.
        Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or
        hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American
        hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style
        IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins
        may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English
        character. See English-style India Pale Ale","ibuMin":"50","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"6.3","abvMax":"7.5","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.06","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21

        Head Craft Brewery","description":"The story of Dogfish Head began in June
        of 1995 when we opened Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats, the first state''s first
        brewpub opened in the resort beach community of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
        The plan was to bring original beer, original food, and original music to
        the area.\r\n\r\nNot only was Dogfish Head Delaware''s first brewpub, it was
        the smallest commercial brewery in America. Our very first batch, Shelter
        Pale Ale, was brewed on a system which essentially was three little kegs with
        propane burners underneath. Brewing 12 gallon batches of beer for a whole
        restaurant proved to be more than a full time job. When the doors to the pub
        first opened, we brewed three times a day, five days a week! The one benefit
        to brewing on such a small system was the ability to try out a myriad of different
        recipes. We quickly got bored brewing the same things over and over that''s
        when we started adding all sorts of weird ingredients and getting kind of
        crazy with the beers!","website":"http:\/\/www.dogfish.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/g0jHqt\/upload_WaJNQt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/g0jHqt\/upload_WaJNQt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/g0jHqt\/upload_WaJNQt-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03
