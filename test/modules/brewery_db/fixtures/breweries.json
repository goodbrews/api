      "description": "(512) Brewing Company is a microbrewery located in the heart of Austin, brewing for the community using as many local, domestic and organic ingredients as possible. The original practice of small breweries supplying their immediate community has been nearly lost, and with it, the quality that is possible from small handcrafted batches. Our beers are built on old world English and Belgian recipes, but enhanced to celebrate bold domestic ingredients. Made with Austin\u2019s mineral rich water, the (512) beers taste like none other.",
